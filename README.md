### General Info
Operacity is the name of a non-existing amateur opera company that I built this website for. It takes into what you would expect a website for such an enterprise to contain. News, a program, a simple ticket purchase engine, image gallery and information about the company and its performers. It is mobile friendly and shows an attempt at a design-conscious approach.
It employs React hooks and router, and although there is a newsletter signup form, there is no backend hookup.
